# mocha234 Deep Learning Repo!

Hello there. Thanks for dropping by.
This is a repo where I store all my Deep Learning Projects.
Personally, I have strong interest in Deep Learning, specifically in Computer Vision. Therefore, most of my projects will be Computer Vision-related.

I'm still learning tho, feel free to give comment or feedback if any via Discord `nelsonwong98#1244` on how I can improve or mistake made, will appreciate it!

## Notebooks

### Classification 
- [Cat vs Dog Classfication](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/Cat-vs-Dog/CatvsDog-Classification.ipynb) --> Classifying if image consist cat or dog.
- [Rock-Paper-Scissor](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/RockPaperScissors/RockPaperScissors-Classification/RockPaperScissors-Classification.ipynb) --> Identify hand sign(whether it is Rock, Paper or Scissor) shown.
- [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/nelsonwongisme/for-dummies-tf-keras-data-augmentation) --> Identify the type of disease present on a Cassava Leaf image. [( a Kaggle Competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)

### Object Detection
- [Face Detection with Haar Cascade](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/ObjectDetection/HaarCascade/DetectFace%20with%20Haar%20Cascade.ipynb) --> Detect Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin's faces with Haar Cascade approach.
