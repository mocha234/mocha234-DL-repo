# mocha234 Deep Learning Repo!

Hello there. Thanks for dropping by.
This is a repo where I store all my Deep Learning Projects.
Personally, I have strong interest in Deep Learning, specifically in Computer Vision. Therefore, most of my projects will be Computer Vision-related.

I'm still learning tho, feel free to give comment or feedback if any via Discord `nelsonwong98#1244` on how I can improve or mistake made, will appreciate it!

## Notebooks

### Classification 
- [Cat vs Dog Classfication](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/Cat-vs-Dog/CatvsDog-Classification.ipynb) --> Classifying if image consist cat or dog.
- [Rock-Paper-Scissor](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/RockPaperScissors/RockPaperScissors-Classification/RockPaperScissors-Classification.ipynb) --> Identify hand sign(whether it is Rock, Paper or Scissor) shown.
- [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/nelsonwongisme/for-dummies-tf-keras-data-augmentation) --> Identify the type of disease present on a Cassava Leaf image. [( a Kaggle Competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)

### Object Detection
- [Face Detection with Haar Cascade](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/ObjectDetection/HaarCascade/DetectFace%20with%20Haar%20Cascade.ipynb) --> Detect Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin's faces with Haar Cascade approach.

###  Segmentation

### Genetic Algorithm
- [Genetic Algorithm with Python](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/GA_with_Python.ipynb) --> Understanding Genetic Algorithm with Python(without libraries)
- Comparing Hyper-parameter Tuning using Cross Validation Grid Search and Genetic Algorithm with PyGAD
	Goal: As per the title. Here, I will build a prediction model with Deep Learning approach with Tensorflow's Keras.
	- [Predicting Student Performance(Empirically)](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/StudentPerformance_with_NN.ipynb) --> Empirically tune hyper-parameters
	- [Predicting Student Performance(SKLearn's GridSearchCV)](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/StudentPerformance_GridSearchCrossValidation.ipynb) --> Tune hyper-parameters with Sci-Kit Learn's GridSearchCV
	- [Predicting Student Performance(Genetic Algorithm with PyGAD)](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/StudentPerformance_PyGAD.ipynb) --> Tune hyper-parameters with GA using PyGAD
	- [Predicting Student Performance(Genetic Algorithm with Trained Model + PyGAD)](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/StudentPerformance_Tensorflow_PyGAD.ipynb) --> Tune GA hyper-parameters using PyGAD of a trained Model
	- [Some Findings, Comparison, Summary](https://github.com/mocha234/mocha234-DL-repo/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/GA_summary.ipynb) --> Summary of this learning "series"
