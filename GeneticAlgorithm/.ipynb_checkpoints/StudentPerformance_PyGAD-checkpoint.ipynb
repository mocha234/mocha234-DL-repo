    "This is a duplicate notebook from StudentPerformance_with_Keras_and_PyGAD. In this notebook I will use a Genetic Algorithm Library, namely PyGAD to find optimal weights instead of doing it with Grid Search Corss Validation and empirically in the previous notebooks.\n",

    "A deep learning model consists of trained/learned weights where the weights can be train by foward and back propagation. However, we need to tune the hyperparameters such as the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Genetic Algorithm, we can train the weights of the Neural Networks easily.\n",
    "By analogy, the model with weight considered as Chromosome/Solution/Individual in a Population(consist of n number of solutions). The goal is to obtain the fittest Chromosome in the population. To achieve thta, the fittest Chromosomes(highest Fitness value) are the Parents will have its offspring knowns as Children throughout Generations with some mutation to it. Since the fittest chromosomes will be chosen to be mated, hence the offspring will be better and better throughout the generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Offsprings, by end of the day, are the \"Best Solution\" or the \"Best Weights\" found and used for making predictions."

    "This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). \n",

    "In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. \n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd-period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details)."
