This method pis slightly better for development compared to Empirical Method and GridSearchCV as GridSearchCV takes up lots of Computation Power and Time, while Empirical Method takes a lot time to manually tune the model.\n",

    "On the other hand, the dataset is considered small(with 649 entries), hence Empirical Method and GridSearchCV is still relevant. However, as for image classification taks or tasks with huge dataset, I think it is not suitable to use neither Empirical Method nor GridSearchCV as every run after tuning takes a lot of time. In that case, PyGAD can be used."
